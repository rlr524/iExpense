    // Note: when creating the shared data use @StateObject, but when youâ€™re just using it in a
    // different view you should use @ObservedObject instead.
    @StateObject var user = User()

// Because @State only works on structs for internal struct state, we need to use the
// @Published property observer in addition to the @StateObject property wrapper to
// pass state around views vs just inside a struct.

// @Published functions in a way like half of how @State functions, it tells Swift that
// whenever the property changes, it should broadcast that change to any SwiftUI views
// that are watching so they should reload. The other half, the part that says which
// instantiated object should be watched, is wrapped using @StateObject.

// Passing ObservableObject as an inherited type alias makes the class conform to the
// ObservableObject protocol, which is required to use @StateObject when we
// instantiate the class above.
class User: ObservableObject {
    @Published var firstName = "Madison"
    @Published var lastName = "Ranf"
